        "The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although where was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",

In this project, you will get to apply machine learning tools to analyze the passenger information from the training set, and analyze what factors may affect a passenger's chance for survival. **You are expected to submit a complete Jupyter notebook with python code (including detailed comments), numerical results, and graphs (with proper labeling) to Blackboard.** The submission deadline is **Sunday, April 24th**.\n"

Please replace the Embarked variable with three variables – Embarked_S, Embarked_C, and Embarked_Q – to indicate the place a passenger boarded the ship. For example, if a passenger boarded from Southamptons, Embarked_S should be set to 1, and Embarked_C and Embarked_Q should be zero.

        "1. Choose features of spam emails manually: \"4U\", \"credit card\", \"free\", \"amazing\"\n",
        "2. Write an program to detect exactly the features you chose\n",
        "3. Test the program and modify the features until satisfactory\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawbacks of traditional approach: \n",
        "1. A large amount of features are needed - hard to maintain\n",
        "2. Spammers may change their writing to avoid explicit rules: change \"4U\" to \"For U\".\n",
        "3. For some complex problems, manually-engineered features are not good enough: hand-written digits\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine Learning models:\n",
        "1. Automatically learns which words and phrases are good predictors of spam. \n",
        "2. Since the program is not a stack of explicit rules, it is much shorter, easier to maintain, and most likely more accurate.\n",
        "3. With new training data, the Machine Learning model can update automatically to capture new indicators of spam emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "What Machine Learning is great for:\n",
        "1. Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.\n",
        "2. Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.\n",
        "3. Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.\n",
